# active-microemulsion - Docs
Documentation for `active-microemulsion` is organized as a collection of Markdown files.
Being documentation as important as the code itself, we want to make sure it is properly stored and versioned 
together with the code.

### Sections
- [Building an executable program](build/build.md)
- [Configuring initial simulation states](configure/configure.md)
- [Running single jobs](run/run.md)
- [Cluster job scheduling](schedule/schedule.md)
